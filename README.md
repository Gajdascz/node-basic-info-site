# node-basic-info-site

Developed as part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-basic-informational-site), this project provided me with introductory knowledge of getting started with a Node.js project.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Update**

  - **Express**
    - Installed and used the Express web application framework to rewrite the routing and serving logic using express's .get() and .sendFile() methods.
    - Gained a fundamental understanding of what express is, how it's used, and why it's powerful.
  - **ES6 Modules**: Updated the application to use ES6 modules in favor of the old require method. Used import.meta.dirname to replace the common js variable \_\_dirname.

- **Node Basics**
  - **Understanding Node.js**
    - Gained a deeper understanding of what node is and how it differs from client-side JavaScript.
    - Learned about Node.js's event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
  - **JavaScript Execution**
    - Explored how JavaScript code is parsed, interpreted, and executed by the V8 engine.
    - Understood how V8 converts JavaScript into machine code.
  - **Use Cases**
    - Identified the primary use cases of Node.js, such as handling server-side logic, API development, and real-time data processing.
  - **Node.js API Documentation**
    - Learned to navigate and utilize the [Node.js api documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) to understand and implement built-in modules.
  - **HTTP Module**
    - Used http module to create a local server that listens for incoming HTTP requests and sends appropriate responses.
    - Implemented basic routing to handle different URL paths and return corresponding HTML pages.
  - **FS Module**
    - Used fs (file-system) module to read and server HTML files in a response to client requests.
    - Managed asynchronous file operations to ensure non-blocking behavior.
  - **Routing**
    - Combined `http` and `fs` modules to create simple routing logic that directs different URLs to different HTML pages.
    - Implemented error handling to server a 404 page for unknown routes.
  - **Debugging**
    - Learned how to setup and utilize VScode's Node debugger using different debug configurations (launch with application and attach to process by id).
    - Learned how to access and launch chrome DevTool's Node specific tools (chrome//inspect) and reviewing network requests.
  - **Practical Application**
    - Built a minimal Node.js application that routes between a few minimal HTML pages, providing a hands-on introduction to server-side JavaScript (Node).
    - Gained experience setting up a Node.js project, running a local server, handling HTTP requests and responses, and debugging a simple node application.
